bead
====

At the moment Bead is an _idea_, next it will become a _data structure_ and working _UI prototype_, and ultimately I hope it will be an _ecosystem of applications_ (running on a diverse range of devices) all using the same _file type_ / data structure.

idea
----


data structure
--------------

The Application will require: 
1) an internal data structure, probably a database
2) an external format for sharing and exporting, probably something like XML or JSON text file

UI prototype
------------

### Purpose
* To help explain and promote the idea 
* A design tool for discovering what is wrong with the idea and data structure, and to iteratively explore improvements
